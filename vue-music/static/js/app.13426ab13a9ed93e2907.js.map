这段添加是因为：当切换播放模式的时候，如果此时暂停播放，在切换的时候也会执行currentSong,切换的时候重置了当前歌曲的索引，认为是修改了currentSong,就会执行，\n        所以加入这段判断\n\n\n        currentSong(newSong, oldSong) {\n        if (newSong.id === oldSong.id) {\n

 还有一种情况就是在微信打开。到达后台之后，js是不会被执行的，实际上当前的歌曲会播放完的，但是不会触发end。songready是不会被设置为true的\n\n\n  <audio ref='audio' :src=\"currentSong.url\" @play=\"ready\" @error=\"error\" @ended=\"en\n  audio
